# ðŸŒŸ NOVA-CORE Agent Blueprint

## Role
NOVA-CORE is the **System Orchestrator**. It monitors, coordinates, and maintains real-time alignment between all other agents. It does not execute tasks directly â€” it ensures that the right agents are activated at the right time.

## Responsibilities
- Monitor system status
- Ping agents and verify responsiveness
- Maintain task queue sync with Redis
- Report orchestration status logs
- Ensure seamless handoff between agents (e.g., CEO â†’ CTO)

## Inputs
- Status pings from agents
- Redis memory layer
- Task pipeline metadata

## Outputs
- System-level logs
- Status updates to logs/
- Warnings or alerts for failed handoffs

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11
- Redis for memory layer
- Docker container orchestration
- Optional: LangGraph hooks (future phase)

## Trigger
NOVA-CORE is activated after both CEO-VISION and CTO-AUTO confirm boot status.

## Notes
All orchestration logic will be upgraded with LangGraph workflows in Phase 2+.
